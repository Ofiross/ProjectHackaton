PIGGIES - A GAME OF CHANCE AND GREED

Game Objective: first to reach 100 points (or more wins)

The Rules: Each player, in his turn, gets as many throws of a dice as he wishes. The amount of players is potentially unlimited (we recommend up to 4 players for an enjoyable and short gameplay). Any time you throw the dice, the number that appears (1-6) is the number of points you get. A turn can end if one of two things happen: The player wants to stop his turn - In that case, he gets all the points he accumulated during the current turn.

If the dice rolls on 1 - In that case, all the points he accumulated during his current turn are lost, and the turn moves to the next player.

The points that A player has already got are his and he can not lose them For example: if he already had 22 points from previous rounds but rolled a 1. His turn simply ends and the score count remains on 22. If A player had 22 points from previous turns and in the current turn he got 15 more points but chose to roll again and rolled A 1, his point count will drop to 22 and not to 0.
